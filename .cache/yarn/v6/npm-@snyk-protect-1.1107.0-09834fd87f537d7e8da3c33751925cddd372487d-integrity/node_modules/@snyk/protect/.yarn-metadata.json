This package is officially maintained by [Snyk](https://snyk.io).\n\n## Usage\n\nYou don't typically need to add the @snyk/protect dependency manually. It'll be introduced when it's needed as part of [Snyk's Fix PR service](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360011484018-Fixing-vulnerabilities).\n\nTo enable patches in your Fix PRs:\n\n- Visit https://app.snyk.io\n- Go to \"Org Settings\" > \"Integrations\"\n- Choose \"Edit Settings\" under your SCM integration.\n- Under the \"Fix Pull Request\" section, ensure patches are enabled.\n\nSnyk will now include patches as part of its Fix PRs for your project.\n\n## How it works\n\nIf there's a patch available for a vulnerability in your project, the Fix PR:\n\n- Adds a `patch` entry to your `.snyk` file.\n- Adds `@snyk/protect` to your `package.json`'s dependencies.\n- Adds `@snyk/protect` to your `package.json`'s [`prepare` script](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/scripts).\n\n```patch\n {\n   \"name\": \"my-project\",\n   \"scripts\": {\n+    \"prepare\": \"npm run snyk-protect\",\n+    \"snyk-protect\": \"snyk-protect\"\n   },\n   \"dependencies\": {\n+    \"@snyk/protect\": \"^1.657.0\"\n   }\n }\n```\n\nNow after you run npm install, @snyk/protect will automatically download each patch configured in your .snyk file and apply them to your installed dependencies.\n\n## Migrating from `snyk protect` to `@snyk/protect`\n\n`@snyk/protect` is a standalone replacement for `snyk protect`. They both do the same job, however:\n\n- `@snyk/protect` has zero dependencies.\n- You don't need to include `snyk` in your dependencies (which is a much larger package with many dependencies).\n\nIf you already have Snyk Protect set up, you can migrate to `@snyk/protect` by applying the following changes to your `package.json`:\n\n```patch\n {\n   \"name\": \"my-project\",\n   \"scripts\": {\n     \"prepare\": \"npm run snyk-protect\",\n-    \"snyk-protect\": \"snyk protect\"\n+    \"snyk-protect\": \"snyk-protect\"\n   },\n   \"dependencies\": {\n-    \"snyk\": \"^1.500.0\"\n+    \"@snyk/protect\": \"^1.657.0\"\n   }\n }\n```\n\nWe have also created the [@snyk/cli-protect-upgrade](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@snyk/cli-protect-upgrade) npx script which you can use to update your project automatically. To use it, `cd` to the location containing the package.json to be updated and run:\n\n```\nnpx @snyk/cli-protect-upgrade\n```\n\n---\n\nMade with ðŸ’œ by Snyk\n"
