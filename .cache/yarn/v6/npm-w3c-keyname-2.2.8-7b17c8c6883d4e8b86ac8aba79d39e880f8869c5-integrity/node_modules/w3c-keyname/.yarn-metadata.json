    "readme": "# W3C keyname\n\nTiny library that exports a function `keyName` that takes a keyboard event and\nreturns a\n[`KeyboardEvent.key`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key)-style\nstring. Will use the actual `key` property of the event if available,\nand fall back to a value synthesized from the `keyCode` otherwise.\n\nProbably often wrong on non-US keyboards, since the correspondence\nbetween a key code and the character it produces when shift is held is\npredicted based on a hard-coded table. Meant as a fallback for\n`KeyboardEvent.key`, not a replacement.\n\nThe lookup tables from key codes (`event.keyCode`) to names are\nexported as `base` (when Shift isn't held) and `shift` (when Shift is\nheld).\n\nLicense: MIT\n",
